        <p>
            i'm going to store information which i need for my insight from coding somthing efficiently.<br>
            so, i will pratice this functions from 20200131 because i like that.

            but, we are human. we have a power of thinking, ratinal idea by brain which still have been<br>

            Like we have done, we will solve this international problems together well. <br><br>
            
            In this situtation, i'm going to gather information by googling, coding. And, i'm going to<br>
            make sections to seperate info's I'll use late to judge somethings(situation, issue, et)
